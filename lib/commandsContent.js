To write multiple lines of code with language syntax highlighting, use three [backticks](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ETTnT.jpg) followed by the language:

\\\`\\\`\\\`js
// your JavaScript code goes here
\\\`\\\`\\\`

**Inline code:**

For \`inline code\` use one backtick (no syntax highlighting):

\\\`code here!\\\`
