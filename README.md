Welcome to the Odin Bot repository! This is the codebase that powers Odin's right-hand bot, which is used by the tens of thousands of dedicated Odinites in the [Discord community of The Odin Project](https://discord.gg/fbFCkYabZB). 

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) is an open-source curriculum for learning full-stack web development. This bot plays a crucial role in our Discord server by displaying helpful information, driving positive engagement through the points system, and incorporating various other nifty features.
